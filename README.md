**Category**: AI/ML + Healthcare + Governance 
**Hackathon**: Hack The Winter - The Second Wave (Angry Bird Edition) 
**Team**: Team Hawks 
**Submission**: Round 1 - The SlingShot

# Executive Summary
**SeemantSaathi** is an **AI-powered rural health assistant** that bridges the healthcare gap in rural India by providing instant *symptom analysis*, connecting users to nearby doctors, and offering emergency medical guidance—all through a simple, *bilingual interface* designed for low-literacy users on basic smartphones.
We built SeemantSaathi because in our village, the nearest doctor is 20km away and the roads are blocked during monsoons.


# Core Value Proposition
*"A virtual first-aid station for every village—bringing medical consultation to your fingertips when doctors are miles away."*


# Quick Stats
- **Target Users**: 600M+ rural Indians with limited healthcare access
- **Doctor-Patient Ratio**: 1:10,000+ in many villages → Our solution
- **Response Time**: <5 seconds for symptom analysis
- **Data Usage**: <500KB for complete consultation
- **Languages**: English & Hindi 
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ disease prediction using AI model


# The Problem We're Solving
- **Rural Healthcare Crisis in India**

| Problem             | Impact                                | Current Solution                 | Gap                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Doctor Shortage     | 1:10,000 doctor–patient ratio         | Travel 20–50 km for consultation | Time-consuming and expensive        |
| Digital Illiteracy  | 40% rural users struggle with apps    | Complex health applications      | Interfaces are hard to use          |
| Connectivity Issues | Unreliable 2G/3G networks             | No offline support               | Frequent application failures       |
| Misinformation      | Medical advice from WhatsApp          | Unverified information sources   | Leads to dangerous practices        |
| Emergency Delays    | 30–60 minutes ambulance response time | Call 108 and wait                | No preparation or guidance provided |

**Example**
- *Our User*: Ram Singh (45, Farmer from Bhimtal)
- *Scenario*: High fever, headache, monsoon season
- **Current Reality**:
    - Travels 15km to nearest clinic (2 hours, ₹500 travel)
    - Waits 3 hours in queue
    - Gets basic consultation
    - Returns home exhausted
- **With SeemantSaathi**:
    - Opens app on basic smartphone
    - Selects "Fever, Headache, Body Pain" (3 taps)
    - Gets instant analysis: "Viral Fever (85%), Dengue risk (10%)"
    - Sees nearest doctor: "Dr. Sharma, 5km, available now"
    - Receives self-care tips while traveling
- **Impact**: Saves 4 hours, ₹500, and gets early warning for dengue risk.

**Note on Development Status**:
This project was built under hackathon time constraints. Some components
(live AI inference, real doctor database, and deployment) are still under
active development. The current prototype focuses on validating feasibility,
system flow, and real-world relevance rather than full production readiness.


## User Data Flow
![Data Flow](./Diagrams/Data%20Flow.drawio.png)

## Key Differentiators
    - **Medical-Grade AI** = BioBERT + Rural Dialect Normalization
    - **Rural-First Design** = Works on 2G, small screens, low literacy
    - **Government Integration Ready** = Ayushman Bharat, e-Sanjeevani APIs
    - **Privacy by Design** = No personal data stored unnecessarily
    - **Emergency-First** = Red flag system for critical symptoms

# Training Results

|Metric | Score | Notes|
|-------|-------|------|
|Global Accuracy | 94.5% | On held-out test set |
|F1-Score	| 0.95 |Weighted average
|Validation Loss | 0.80	| Stabilized at Epoch 10

**Evaluation Context**:
Accuracy was measured on a limited, clean test split of the Symptom2Disease
dataset. We acknowledge that real-world rural inputs may introduce noise
(language mixing, incomplete symptoms), which can reduce live accuracy.
Improving robustness on noisy inputs is a key focus for Round 2.

# User Experience & Design
- **Rural-First Design Principles**
    - Simplicity Over Complexity: Natural Language Input (Describe symptoms in your own words).
    - Visual Over Text: Icons + minimal Hindi/English
    - Intermittent Connectivity Support. 
    - Low Data: <500KB complete app load
    - Emergency Prominent: Red flag always visible


# Impact & Scalability

| Phase   | Timeline | Coverage          | Expected Reach |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Phase 1 | 6 Months | Bhimtal       | few test users   |
| Phase 2 | 1 Year   | Uttarakhand | spread accross villages |
| Phase 3 | 2 Years  | Northen States         | expected more users      |

# Challenges We Ran Into
* **Handling "Hinglish":** The tokenizer struggled with mixed inputs like "Head dukhing." We had to build a custom regex map to normalize these before passing them to BioBERT.
* **Model Size and Speed:** The BioBERT model was too slow for a real-time chat. We are currently working on quantizing it to reduce inference time.
